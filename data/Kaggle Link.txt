Challenge Name --- Stanford Ribonanza RNA Folding


Feature Description:

sequence_id - (string) An arbitrary identifier like 8cdfeef009ea for each sequence.
sequence - (string) Describes the RNA sequence, a string of A, C, G, and U.
experiment_type - (string) Either DMS_MaP or 2A3_MaP to describe the type of chemical mapping experiment that was used to generate each profile. References: DMS, 2A3.
dataset_name - (string) arbitrary name of high throughput sequencing dataset from which the reactivity profile was extracted.
reads - (integer) Number of reads in the high throughput sequencing experiment that were assigned to the RNA sequence, and whose mutations were tabulated to compile the reactivity profile. (These values do not need to be predicted in this competition.)
signal_to_noise - (float) Signal/noise value for the profile, defined as mean(measurement value over probed positions)/mean( statistical error in measurement value over probed positions). Probed positions are those positions that not null in reactivity or reactivity_error, that have non-zero reactivity_error; the very first and last such position in any given profile are also dropped for calculating signal_to_noise. (These values do not need to be predicted in this competition.)
SN_filter - (Boolean) 0 or 1 depending on whether the profile has signal_to_noise> 1.00 and reads> 100. For evaluation, only sequences whose DMS_MaP and 2A3_MaP profiles both pass this filter will be used to score submissions. (These values do not need to be predicted in this competition.)
reactivity_0001, reactivity_0002,… - (float) An array of floating point numbers of the train data, should have the same length as the RNA sequence, which defines the reactivity profile for the RNA. These are the type of data that need to be predicted in this competition. For sequences shorter than the maximum RNA length, positions that go beyond the sequence length have null. Several positions near the beginning and end of the sequence also cannot be probed due to technical reasons, and their reactivity values are null. The values should be greater than or equal to zero, but due to experimental errors can become negative. The values are normalized so that the 90th percentile value within each dataset is 1.0.
reactivity_error_0001, reactivity_error_0002,… - (float) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as the corresponding reactivity_* columns, calculated errors in experimental values obtained in reactivity derived from counting statistics in the high-throughput sequencing experiment. (These values do not need to be predicted in this competition.)
