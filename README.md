# RNA Sequence Reactivity Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the reactivity of drugs to RNA sequences using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging the power of PyTorch and the Fast.ai library, we've developed a model that processes RNA sequence data to predict how effective a drug might be in binding or reacting to these sequences. Such predictions are invaluable in the fields of bioinformatics and pharmacogenomics, where understanding the interaction between drugs and RNA plays a crucial role in drug development and personalized medicine.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Includes scripts for cleaning and preparing RNA sequence data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes PyTorch and Fast.ai to train a deep learning model on processed data.
- **Prediction**: Offers tools to predict drug reactivity with new RNA sequences.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization tools to interpret the model predictions and understand the model's decision-making process.
